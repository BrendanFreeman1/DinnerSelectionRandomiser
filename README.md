  <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>
      This is an app to help select what to have for dinner each week. 
      You can store the recipes you love in the app and from that randomise a seven day meal plan at the click of a button.
      Once you have the meals you want for the week selected you can save that meal plan to the app and view a list 
      of all the ingredients you'll need to make them.

      'What's for Dinner' is a portflio project used to better my understanding of creating a program from scratch. 
      I was able to vastly improve my competency with the C# language as well as diving into and learning working within the .NET Framework,             working with Xamarin and how to integrate and utilise SQLite.
